                    Firstly we must say that Wolfgang Pauli theorised Neutrinos in 1930 to explain how beta decay follows and obays
                    the laws of conservation. He claimed that a neucleaus as well as releasing a beta particle (ussualy and electron) 
                    it would also emit a Neutrino. This was furtherd by Enrico Fermi, who proposed that in beta decay a neutron decayed into a proton;
                    electron; and a Neutrino.

                        The neutrino doesnt have a defined size, but is roughly one milions times smaller then an electron

                    <span class="bold slant">Now how did we detect them?</span>
                    well Clyde Cowan and frederick Reines devised an experiment where in they used a neuclear reactor to emit anitneutrinos creating a large
                    neutrino flux* (the reactor they used had a neutrino fulx of  5Ã—10^13 neutrinos per second per square centimeter), from here they used 2 vary large containers of water
                    as secnsors , as the dense water priveded a large area for the Neutrinosto come in contact with.

                <p class="p2-right">
                    <span class="bold slant">Next you may ask; how do they use water as a detector?</span> well, when the neutrino comes in contact with (interacts) with a 
                    proton in the water, neutrons and positrons are created. Then he two gamma rays created by positron annihilation were detected by sandwiching the water tanks between tanks filled with liquid scintillator*(idk what that is)

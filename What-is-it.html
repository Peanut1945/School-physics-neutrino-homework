                In short a neutrinos (represented by the greek letter neu -ν) is a fundamental particle of physics (and matter). 
                This means that it has no substructure, again meaning that it <span class="bold slant">cannot</span>
                be broken down into smaller parts.
            </p>
            <p class="second-child">
                As well as this it has a very small mass - infact it used to be thought
                that it had no mass- so the gravitational force exerted on it becomes negligible. Further the Neutrino has no charge
                so creates even less effect on the enviroment around it as they dont experience the electromagnetic force.
                Finaly on this point they are leptons , this means that they dont experience the strong force (whatever that might be).

                Interestingly enough, we have observed that ther are <span class="bold slant">3</span> differnt types of Neutrino; these are as follows:
                electron Neutrinos, muon Neutrinos and tau Neutrinos (all of which are also other sub atomic, fundamental particles).
                Not only this but the Neutrino has a mass of  9.11 × 10^-31 kilograms (which is very small!!)

                    Did you know that Neutrinos have often been descirbed as <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/animation-ghost-spooky-YARUMKaGd8cRG" class="spooky">spooky</a>
                    as it ussually travels through objects without interacting with them in any obervable way!!!
